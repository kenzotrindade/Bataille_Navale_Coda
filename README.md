## 📋 About The Project

This project was developed as part of the **Coda** curriculum. The goal was to create a functional browser-based game without using frameworks, relying solely on **native PHP** and a **MySQL database**.

The challenge was to manage the game state (whose turn it is, where ships are located, hits and misses) strictly through server-side logic and database queries.
